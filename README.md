# hello-world
first day as a web developer. this is a test file

Hello fellow Humans!

My name is bxfz, also go by Falcon. I hope that this is the beginning of my development journey.  Many moons ago I studied programming in school, but I ended up landing in a completely different line of work.

I feel now is the best time for me to dive back in to the computer world, and slowly make this a fun hobby of mine.  Who knows, maybe I'll even find a job. Only time will tell!
